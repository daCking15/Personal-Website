            <p class=description>Tanks 3D is a turn based multiplayer game built from the ground up in Unity. Each game is procedurally generated meaning that the terrain, ground texture, skybox, and tree placement will be different every time you play. The goal of the game is to destroy your opponents tank. Pay attention to the mini map, the wind speed, the wind direction, your shot angle, and your shot power level to succeed. Players have the option to use keyboard controls or an Xbox One controller. Please look at the controls before playing because they are relatively complex. There are currently two versions available. The first version that I would recommend playing is the Windows 10 build. In order to run this version, download the zip file from the link above, extract the folder, and then run the .exe file. The second version is the Web GL version. In order to run this version, download the zip file from the link above, extract the folder, and then run the .html file. However, please be aware that the Web GL version does not run as well as the Windows 10 version. Lastly, please keep in mind that this is my most ambitious project yet. There will be bugs. On occasion, a tank will fall through the map at the beginning of the game. If this happens, simply reload the game. I hope you enjoy and and I hope you try playing Tanks 3D against a friend! </p>
